Message Application Project

This project is a messaging application developed using C# and SQL. It allows users to log in, create new accounts, send messages, and view received and sent messages. The application is designed with a user-friendly interface and includes the following features:

Features
- Login Screen: Users can log in using their number and password. There is also an option for users without an account to create a new one.
- New Account Screen: Users can create an account by entering their name, surname, and password. The system automatically assigns a number, which is displayed on the account creation screen.
- All Messages Screen: Main screen contains the following;
  - Inbox: Displays messages sent to the user in a DataGridView.
  - Sent Items: Shows the messages that the user has sent.
  - New Message Screen: Opens a form to write a new message, where the receiver's number, message title, and content are entered. After sending the message, the user can return to the main screen using the back button.
  - My Account Screen: A form where users can view, update their profile details (name, surname, and password; except for the number) using the 'Update' and delete their accounts using the 'Delete' button. After doing any of these actions, users can return to the main page using the 'Return to the Messages Screen' button.
  - Sign Out: The user logs out and returns to the login screen.
